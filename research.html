<span class="abs-non"><br/>
<span class="abstract">
We extend Siksek's development of Chabauty's method for computing the set of $S$-integral points on restrictions of scalars of curves over \(\mathcal O_{K,S}\) to curves which are not necessarily complete. When the curve is \(\mathcal C = \mathbb P^1 \smallsetminus \{0, 1, \infty\}\), we show that after replacing the curve with a suitable descent set of covers, the method has no base change obstructions. We also use the method to prove that \( \mathcal C(\mathcal O_{K}) \) is finite for several classes of fields \( K \), including that \( \mathcal C(\mathcal O_{K}) = \emptyset \) when 3 splits completely in \(K\). This represents the first infinite class of cases where Chabauty's method for restrictions of scalars is proved to show that \( \mathcal C(\mathcal O_{K}) \) is finite where the classical Chabauty's method cannot.

We describe an algorithm to compute the zeta function of a cyclic cover of the projective line over a finite field of characteristic \(p\) that runs in time \(p^{1/2+o(1)}.\)
We confirm its practicality and effectiveness by reporting on the performance of our SageMath implementation on a range of examples.
The algorithm relies on Gon\c{c}alves's generalization of Kedlaya's algorithm for cyclic covers, and Harvey's work on Kedlaya's algorithm for large characteristic.

	  <span class="abstract">
	    Given a structured random matrix ensemble where each random variable
	    occurs o(N) times in each row and the limiting rescaled spectral
	    measure exists, we fix a \(p \in [1/2,1]\) and study the ensemble of signed
	    structured matrices by multiplying the \((i,j)\)th and \((j,i)\)th entries of
	    a matrix by a randomly chosen \(\varepsilon(i,j) \in {1,-1}\), with
	    Prob\((\epsilon(i,j)) = p\) (i.e., the Hadamard product.) For \(p = 1/2\)
	    the limiting signed rescaled spectral measure is the semi-circle; for
	    other \(p\) it has bounded (resp., unbounded) support if the limiting
	    rescaled spectral measure has bounded (resp., unbounded) support, and 
	    converges to the limitin rescaled spectral measure as \(p \to 1\). The
	    proofs are by Markov's Method of Moments, and involve the pairings of
	    \(2k\) vertices on a circle. The contribution of each pairing in the 
	    signed case is weighted by a factor depending on p and the number of 
	    vertices involved in at least one crossing. These numbers are of 
	    interest in their own right, appearing in problems in combinatorics
	    and knot theory. The number of configurations with no vertices 
	    involved in a crossing is well-studied (the Catalan numbes). We
	    discover and prove similar formulas for other configurations.

	  <span class="abstract">
	    A subset \(\mathcal A\) of \(\{0,1,...,n\}\) is said to be a 2-additive basis for \(\{1,2,...,n\}\) if each \(j \in \{1,2,...,n\}\) can be written as \(j=x+y, x,y \in \mathcal A, x \leq y\). If we pick each integer in \(\{0,1,...,n\}\) independently with probability \(p=p_n\) tending to \(0\), thus getting a random set \(\mathcal A\), what is the probability that we have obtained a 2-additive basis? We address this question when the target sum-set is \([(1-\alpha)n, (1+\alpha)n]\) (or equivalently \([\alpha n, (2-\alpha) n])\) for some \(0 < \alpha < 1\). Under either model, the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation is used, in conjunction with Janson's inequalities, to tease out a very sharp threshold for the emergence of a 2-additive basis. Generalizations to \(k\)-additive bases are then given.

<span class="abs-non"><br/>
	  <span class="abstract">
In 2016, Vizovska proved that the \(E_8\) lattice gives the densest sphere packing problem in \(8\)-dimesions [<a href="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2017/185-3/p07">V16</a>]. Shortly thereafter,  Cohn, Kumar, Miller, Radchenko, and Viazovska [<a href=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2017/185-3/p08>CKM+16</a>] proved that the Leech lattice gives the densest sphere packing in \(24\)-dimensions. Their proofs find feasible solutions to the the Cohn-Elkies LP-method [<a href=http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2003/157-2/p09>CE03</a>] to give upper bounds on the density of sphere packings in \(8\) and \(24\) dimensions that match sphere packings centered on the \(E_8\) and Leech lattice respectively.

 We prove that in contrast to the situation in dimensions \(8\) and \(24\), the LP-method is insufficient to prove that the densest known sphere packing is indeed the densest sphere packing in \(12, 16, 20, 28, 32\) dimensions. The obstructions comes from modular forms. We describe a general method involving linear programming over spaces of modular forms which appears to be the obstruction making the LP-method insufficient to solve the sphere packing problem in these dimensions.
